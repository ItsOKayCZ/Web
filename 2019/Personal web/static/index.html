                  Welcome, my name is Oldrich Krupauer and I am 16 years old. I would consider myself as a enthusiast in computer science. I am mostly interested in programming and cybersecurity.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  When I started programming I was about 12 years old. I was always a type of person that was interested how things work. As a little kid I played a lot of video games and wanted to know how they are made and make games by myself aswell, but I was too small that time.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  After a few years I started to a hobby class for coding websites. It was so interesting for, because I never done anything like that before. After taking that hobby class I created a chess game. I was so proud of myself that I could finally make something on a computer. After I started to get into programming in C, C++ and python.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  While I was programming and making websites tendency to learn something about hacking. Hacking for me was like magic. Taking control over a diffrent computer and not even touching it. Doing some research I found that there are "hacking competitions" also know CTF. Started to learn about binary exploitation, stack overflows, format strings, heap overflows, etc. Now I want to get into web security and even bug hunting.
